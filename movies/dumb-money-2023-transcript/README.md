Guess what I’m trying to understand is<br>
What is the reason for this delay exactly? Yeah.<br>
Specifically? Mr. Plotkin, I’m so sorry.<br>
But it’s just that when we-we set out…<br>
Yeah, we closed in November.<br>
We had all the permit applications in before the end of the year. Right.<br>
Once we get the final stamp of approval…<br>
And we can’t get the trucks here a little early?<br>
Just, you know, get ’em started?<br>
Miami Beach ordinances won’t let me do that.<br>
Is anyone actually enforcing those right now?<br>
Look, Mr. Plotkin, I know that you’re eager to move in. Okay?<br>
Once we get the final stamp of approval…<br>
No. Uh… [LINE BEEPING]<br>

Can I get a couple of Heinies, please? Uh, one.<br>
Sorry, uh… What?<br>
I’m gonna have a… What’s wrong with a Heinie?<br>
Drinking it since we were 17.<br>
Hey, drink what you like. No judgment.<br>
Uh, you have a Hamm’s? I’ll have one of those.<br>
The fuck did you just order?<br>
Oh, it’s a nice one, out of Milwaukee.<br>
Good quality. 50 cents a can before markup.<br>
Come on, Kitty. Forget about price.<br>
Get him a Heineken. Thank you. It’s on me.<br>
Thanks, man. Thank you. That’s nice.<br>
I’ll have a Hamm’s.<br>
So a Heineken and a Hamm’s? Thank you.<br>
Please. Thank you, Ruby.<br>

Working on my portfolio. That’s the last thing you should be worrying about right now.<br>
Why? It’s a… it’s a good distraction.<br>
Let me take that over for you.<br>
We got thousands of analysts at B of A that do just this. All good, man.<br>
Thank you. Come on, Kitty.<br>
You should be focused on your family right now, not fucking around with penny stocks.<br>
They’re not all penny stocks.<br>
GameStop isn’t a penny stock.<br>
[CHUCKLES] GameStop? Dude.<br>
You used to love GameStop. Yeah, then I grew up.<br>
Well, I think it’s undervalued. [SCOFFS]<br>
I just sold off a bunch of other shit to double down.<br>
How much are we talking? A grand?<br>
Fifty. Bucks?<br>
Grand. 53 grand.<br>
[LAUGHS] Yeah.<br>

Man, you don’t even own a house.<br>
It’s got a ton of short interest, which is artificially… You got a one-year-old.<br>

Wall Street gets it wrong all the time.<br>
Look at ’08. That was a one-off, Kitty.<br>
These guys, they have all the money and the fancy degrees and the political juice in the world, and they get it wrong all the time.<br>
Are you out of your fucking mind?<br>
They got the advantage, and they still get it wrong. [STAMMERS]<br>
No, give me that.<br>
I’m drinking it, even if it’s 50 cents.<br>
It’s four bucks.<br>
Well, my man just spent 53K on a penny stock, so all he can afford is water.<br>
You’re a Wall Street guy? Very much no.<br>
I’m a Wall Street guy. What was the stock?<br>
GameStop.<br>
The video game store at the mall.<br>
You really bought $53,000 of it?<br>
Yeah, I don’t believe it. I think he’s fucking with us.<br>
You’re fucking with us, right?<br>
You don’t even have 50 grand.<br>
Let’s see.<br>
RUBY: Oh, shit.<br>
How is she falling for this? How are you falling for this?<br>
He won’t spend five bucks for a beer, but he’ll put 50k in a stock that you think is a joke.<br>

Uh, but today I’m gonna try something a little different.<br>
I appreciate the feedback you guys have been leaving me, by the way.<br>
Uh… Oh.<br>
More feedback coming in hot.<br>
“Less cats.”<br>

Thanks for the comments.<br>
Uh, we’re gonna come back to them at the end.<br>

Uh, I’m gonna pick a stock and talk about why I think it’s interesting.<br>
And that stock is…<br>

[CHUCKLES] Uh…<br>
I know it’s a polarizing stock and some of you are probably gonna tune out of the stream right now when you hear I’m bullish on GameStop, but I am.<br>
You can see it is now the biggest position by far in the Roaring Kitty portfolio.<br>
So, yeah, I think everyone else is crazy, and I think I’m right, but I’ve been wrong plenty of times in the past, so… [CHUCKLES]<br>
Uh, so there are a lot of aspects to this bull thesis, a lot of moving parts, but I boil it down to what I consider the three overs:<br>
The digital risks seem to me to be overblown, the negative sentiment is overdone– you can see it with the huge short interest– and the value is overlooked.<br>
Wall Street just doesn’t see it.<br>
Why?<br>
Mr. Market, why?<br>
The hedge funds are overlooking the value in the company just like they overlook the people who shop there.<br>
They assume most people download games online now.<br>
But, look, 25% of gamers still buy new discs from GameStop, and 40% buy used games from the store.<br>
And the market’s kind of forced my hand here.<br>
What more can I say? I just like the stock.<br>
DONALDSON: Hey!<br>
[GRUNTS] Shit!<br>
Oh, did I wake you? It’s okay, Mr. Donaldson.<br>
Mr. Donaldson, I need you in your bed.<br>
Kieran, can you please make sure that Mr. Donaldson…<br>
I don’t need to go to bed. I need a cup of coffee.<br>
We can get you a cup of coffee.<br>

Well, isn’t that beautiful?<br>
JENNY: Oh, shit.<br>

It’s an investment video.<br>
Hey, Jenny, for real, I wouldn’t take investment advice from a guy in a cat shirt.<br>
Oh, okay. Who do you take investment advice from?<br>
I don’t have investments. Mm-hmm.<br>
And if I did, I’d listen to, like… [BREATHES DEEPLY] a banker.<br>
Just the way they like it.<br>
“They.”<br>
[LAUGHING]<br>
Oh, boy. Here we go.<br>
Just never mind. No, no, no, please tell me.<br>
I’m dying to know what Luke Wilson from <em>The Royal Tenenbaums</em> thinks we should do with our $68,000 a year.<br>
Who from what? Ugly Björn Borg.<br>
JENNY: Okay, fine. Wall Street is betting that this company is gonna fail.<br>
It’s called shorting.<br>
And if it fails, well, then everybody loses their job, but these hedge fund assholes make a shit ton of money.<br>
It’s bullshit.<br>
It’s a bullshit way for rich people to get richer.<br>

Costco?<br>
Shopko.<br>
It was, like, this, like, big chain in our area.<br>
My dad, he worked his way all the way up from bag boy to general manager.<br>
Then one of these Wall Street funds came in, bought it and vampire-sucked all the money out of it and then declared bankruptcy.<br>

He lost his pension, everything.<br>

We created commission-free trading so that anyone can get in the game.<br>

People have really responded.<br>
We’ve added five million users, uh, in the last six months, for a total of, uh…<br>
Close to 20 at this point, million.<br>
NAT: So, you’re one of these tech companies that’s exploded growth-wise but doesn’t make any money.<br>
We make money. But how?<br>
If you don’t charge commission, then…<br>
From interest on people’s accounts.<br>
But your users are mostly young.<br>
So how much money can they really be keeping in their account?<br>
There’s also payment for order flow.<br>
What’s that? VLAD: We prefer the term “stock order routing.”<br>
When you buy or sell stock on our app, we send your order to market makers who process the order.<br>
They pay us a tiny rebate on every trade.<br>
Tiny. But it adds up.<br>
We should really get back to how we started our company.<br>

STEPHEN COLBERT: Here-Here’s what’s going on.<br>
Late last year, hedge funds started shorting stock in the retail store GameStop, meaning they had bet against it and needed it to drop in price for their investments to be successful.<br>
Now, unfortunately for the hedge funds, small investors started buying the stock, led by something called WallStreetBets, a popular, juvenile, foul-mouthed Reddit page.<br>
And when WallStreetBets noticed that hedge funds had taken a large short position in GameStop stock, they decided to punish the Wall Street big boys and launched a coordinated buying spree.<br>
The revolutionaries on Reddit are spanking Wall Street’s ass.<br>
GameStop shares absolutely going nuts.<br>
I think, um, it was up over 70% at one point.<br>
Massive short squeeze, closing there with a gain of 51%…<br>
KEITH: Show me the tendies!<br>

[LAUGHING] Whoa!<br>
Okay, now if you’ve been watching this price action, this is what I’m talking about. Yeah, but you can really feel that panic from Wall Street, right?<br>
When they start-starting to feel a little squeeze.<br>
Starting to feel– You’re starting to really feel a little squeeze. Oh, I need a drink.<br>

Thank you. [CHUCKLES]<br>
How was your day? Long.<br>
It’s so hard to keep them focused on Zoom school.<br>
They’re just not into it.<br>
How was your day?<br>
GABE [MOUTH FULL]: Good.<br>
You’re not worried about the short squeeze thing?<br>
The dam will break next week.<br>
A few of them will decide it’s gone high enough, they’ll cash out, the rest will follow, whole thing will come crashing down.<br>
I can’t think of the last short squeeze that actually worked.<br>
Ackman and Herbalife.<br>
Before that, Piggly Wiggly. [CHUCKLES]<br>
Piggly Wiggly?<br>
Yeah, 1923, a bear cartel was shorting the Piggly Wiggly grocery store.<br>
Founder, he takes out a loan for what would be $150 million today.<br>
He buys back almost all the stock, like 99% of the stock.<br>
The price of the stock goes up 50%.<br>
How much is GameStop up? Then the exchange, they-they-they halt trading on the stock so the short sellers can cover their positions.<br>
Is that legal?<br>
The founder had to declare bankruptcy, so… it was all fine in the end.<br>
And you knew all that or you looked it up?<br>
Every fund manager knows that story.<br>
You looked it up. [CHUCKLES SOFTLY]<br>
Double-checked some numbers maybe.<br>
STEVE [GROANS]: Do you see what’s going on at GME?<br>
GABE: There’s more of these idiots?<br>
A lot more. GABE: They won’t hold much longer.<br>
STEVE: Oh, Gabe, honey, they’re holding.<br>
It just crossed a hundred.<br>
[NEWSCAST PLAYING INDISTINCTLY OVER TV]<br>
Gabe?<br>
Where are you?<br>
You should probably dial in.<br>
Yeah, be on in one sec.<br>
NEWSMAN: GameStop, extraordinary volatility today.<br>
You know, we might want to make this the stock of the day now that it’s gaining 103%.<br>
That is volatility.<br>
NEWSMAN 2: I will tell you, I’ve never seen anything like it.<br>
Uh, I’m concerned about it deeply.<br>
I’m calling it the ultimate short squeeze.<br>
How much money is being made? Holy fucking shit.<br>
…now we’re gonna talk about GameStop. Those shares…<br>
Holy fucking shit. …that stock is earning about 130% today, as bullish retail traders frenetically buy shares. Holy fucking shit.<br>
Yo, holy shit!<br>
Shit balls!<br>
Holy shit! NEWSWOMAN: You look at the chart for the month, it’s up 220%.<br>
RIRI: Oh, fuck!<br>
Everything okay? Oh, there, yeah. It’s crazy.<br>
Holy fucking shit. Holy fucking shit.<br>
…if you go short in some of these elaborate options trades, you can lose money to infinity.<br>
NEWSMAN 3: GameStop now, uh, 123 and change, another record high.<br>
Holy fucking shit.<br>
NEWSMAN 4: …completely disconnected from the fundamentals, and this is very much being driven by retail investors, many of them trading on Robinhood.<br>
NEWSMAN 2: When the music stops, somebody is gonna be left without a seat.<br>
This is for casino money only.<br>
We’re literally putting the “game” in GameStop.<br>
…GameStop is the craziest I think I’ve ever seen.<br>
True investors never heard of Reddit a few years ago, but for that to drive a short squeeze…<br>
NEWSMAN 5: It is WallStreetBets.<br>
It’s worth going to the site because it’s incredibly compelling.<br>
You may think it’s fraught, but they’re using arguments that they think, uh, hold up under scrutiny.<br>
I just like the stock.<br>
HARMONY: I can’t look.<br>
I can’t look. I can’t look. It’s up another four percent.<br>
I’m gonna have a fucking heart attack.<br>
Should we sell? And betray your boyfriend?<br>
Absolutely not. No. Maybe.<br>
DAVID FABER: Uh, the stock’s up 581%.<br>
[OVERLAPPING CHATTER] They are being very specific.<br>
To break the shorts. Yes.<br>
I mean, what’s going on at GameStop right now conceivably could take a couple of firms out, hedge funds, if they were s-stupid enough to be short.<br>
Babe, how much did we make today?<br>
Five million.<br>
And yesterday?<br>
Four million.<br>
Babe.<br>
Yeah?<br>
We’re, like, really fucking rich.<br>
How much did we lose today?<br>
A billion.<br>
And yesterday?<br>
A billion.<br>
[GROANS]<br>
NEWSMAN 2: Some news to bring you right now is that Melvin Capital Management– this is the hedge fund that had shorted, uh, this company, that had effectively been attacked by an army of investors trying to push up and press up the stock of GameStop– they’ve taken, uh, a rather huge loss…<br>
WOMAN: Sorry, if you could just put your head up for a sec.<br>
Thanks.<br>

‘Cause the word on the street is that you’re-you’re drowning.<br>

You’re on the record with that?<br>
Obviously. [CHUCKLES] All right, man.<br>
Well, then we’re gonna get the live feed up right now, and then we’re gonna get to you right after this next, uh, advertising break.<br>
Perfect. Great. Yes, can’t wait.<br>

I-I really do think this is the right time for you to communicate.<br>
Great, yes. Agreed. Great. Mm-hmm.<br>

No. Come on, Gabe.<br>
We’re on in ten seconds.<br>

How much did he offer?<br>
I haven’t called him back yet.<br>
Well, how much do you need?<br>

NEWSMAN [VOICE-OVER]: Both Citadel, uh, and Point72…<br>
Poor guy. [CHUCKLES] …have infused three billion dollars into, uh, Melvin Capital to try to shore up…<br>
Another goddamn bailout.<br>
Can you believe this crap?<br>
Nobody bailed me out when Richard left me alone with two toddlers, a mortgage, a shit car that never works.<br>
You can say “shit” but we can’t?<br>
JENNY: It’s just so damn unfair, and you know it.<br>
All we’ve done for the last year is work our asses off helping people, and all we’ve gotten is one $600 check.<br>
This idiot effs up just about as bad as anyone can eff, and his friends come running in with three billion dollars.<br>
That’s why I keep telling you You’re never gonna win.<br>
Just take the money and do something nice.<br>
Pay off your mortgage. Get that one braces.<br>
Look who’s still holding.<br>
[SIGHS]<br>
If he’s in, I’m in.<br>
Yeah, he’s still gonna need braces.<br>
Your teeth are perfect. So what? The stock’s up $150?<br>
How much higher is it gonna go? We control the price now, not Wall Street, and no one on there is selling.<br>
Shoes. Ugh.<br>
You’re all so delusional.<br>
JENNY: Maybe, but look at what we’ve managed to do with these hedge funds.<br>
If we keep driving up the price, maybe we’ll scare more of these guys into closing out their shorts, and then all of that bailout money…<br>
Wait. …becomes ours.<br>

STEVE GILL: You’re an asshole.<br>
Don’t kid us. Uh, it’s-it’s real.<br>
Yeah, it’s real, and he’s refusing to sell.<br>
What is going on?<br>
You’re pulling our leg.<br>
No. Your son’s a huge Internet celebrity now.<br>

Are you in trouble? No. No, he’s not in trouble.<br>

Hedge fund managers, they go on CNBC all the time to pump up a stock.<br>
All I do is post my balance sheet on WallStreetBets after market close.<br>
You post your balance sheet?<br>
Yeah, the same idiot who left a fresh pair of Nikes out on the bleachers for just anyone to take.<br>
So you admit they were stolen. We got to talk about this.<br>

A month ago today, it was trading at about 20 bucks per share.<br>
Two days ago, it was under $80.<br>
Today, nearly $350 a share.<br>
The GameStop stock frenzy even now has the attention of the White House.<br>
JEN PSAKI: …of course, our economic team, including Secretary Yellen and others, are monitoring, uh, the situation.<br>
You’re witnessing the French Revolution of finance.<br>
There is a rebellion aspect to it.<br>
There is an antiestablishment aspect to it.<br>
I-I don’t know if Wall Street’s ever seen it like this before, Cher. No.<br>
We never have. It’s generational.<br>
It’s like, uh, generational injustices or like…<br>

We’ve been watching shares of GameStop all day long.<br>
After hitting a staggering high of $483, the shares are now down to about 140.<br>
Now, the best we can tell is the Robinhood app, that seems to have triggered what really has become a panic sell-off in this name.<br>
And so if you’re a retail investor or a Reddit user and you’ve held, well, you are feeling some serious pain right now.<br>
[SIGHS] Oh, God.<br>

Why couldn’t people buy the GameStop shares?<br>
The people demand an answer.<br>
To give you some background, I’m chief executive of Robinhood.<br>
Yeah, we know that. [INDISTINCT CHATTER, LAUGHTER]<br>
And I just want to say, we had no liquidity problem.<br>
Well, did something maybe shady go down here?<br>
Seems weird that you’d get a sudden ten billion dollar demand, you know… Three. Three billion.<br>
Okay, thr-three billion just suddenly out of nowhere, um, and…<br>
Well, I wouldn’t impute any shadiness to-to any of this.<br>
Um, I don’t have the full context, uh, as to what was going on with the NSCC to-to, uh, make these calculations.<br>
To what degree are you beholden to Citadel?<br>
I mean, like, basically, if Citadel is unhappy, then what happens?<br>
Is anyone, is anyone holding you hostage right now?<br>
[CHUCKLES] Uh, n-no. [LAUGHS]<br>
There’s just no rational explanation on why they would do what they did without outside pressure, interference.<br>
And they basically cratered the stock on purpose.<br>
So, I-I just don’t believe anything that guy says.<br>
I wanted to take a cold shower after seeing him say that.<br>
Robinhood is facing lawsuits. We know that.<br>
After halting trades, they are accused of rigging the market.<br>
When the big guys, including one of your main investors in your company, started to lose, you shut down the game to starve the little guy.<br>
They’re stealing from the poor and giving back to the rich!<br>
They’re robbing from the hood!<br>
Why?! I want to be 100% clear.<br>
All of you guys deserve to go burn in hell and go to jail.<br>
This decision to restrict trade was not made…<br>

Hi. Can I interest you in some champagne or a mimosa? Is it free?<br>
It is when you sit up here.<br>
Well, there’s a last time for everything.<br>
Oh. You’ll come back. I had half a million in stocks last week, but Wall Street cheated.<br>
Surprise, surprise.<br>
I could’ve cashed out.<br>
I could’ve paid my mortgage.<br>
Could’ve got my kid braces, got a new car.<br>
[WHISPERS] Honey, I’m gonna get you something stronger.<br>
Thank you. You’re welcome.<br>
KEVIN: Meow. Kitty.<br>
You know you can’t just eat other people’s food?<br>
They do reviews, right? [SCOFFS] Very funny.<br>
Here.<br>
What’s this?<br>
Look, they were on sale, all right, before you get all emotional and shit.<br>
Holy shit, you fucking softy.<br>
Who put you up to this? Caro? Ma?<br>
No, Dad. Called me in tears, said my big brother needed some moral support. Ha ha. Fuck off.<br>
I can’t. Come on, man.<br>
Will you at least try ’em on, please? [SIGHS]<br>
Try ’em. Come on, you’re the richest man in Brockton.<br>
You dress like an asshole. I lost 15 million yesterday and another 15 the day before that.<br>
You’re still the richest man in Brockton, like, by far.<br>
Bro, you got rich dudes pissing in their pants right now.<br>
I mean, come on, man.<br>
How many people from Brockton High can say that?<br>
This has gone crazy.<br>
I got reporters hounding me outside my house.<br>
Yeah, man, me, too. They’re coming after you.<br>
You didn’t talk to them, did you?<br>
What do I look like? I said no.<br>
I said, “Give me 50 grand, maybe.”<br>
Tell me you’re kidding. Well, if you give me 20, then maybe we wouldn’t have to deal with this shit.<br>
The fuck is wrong with you?!<br>
Kevin! I’ve just been subpoenaed by Congress, man.<br>
I do not have time for your bullshit.<br>
Oh, come off it, man! Seriously, asshole!<br>
Chill! Fuck!<br>
It was a joke!<br>
[KEITH SIGHS]<br>
[KEITH GROANS]<br>
I know.<br>
Sorry.<br>
[KEITH SIGHS HEAVILY]<br>
We never used to fight this much.<br>
Sara. I miss her.<br>
Me, too.<br>
She kept your ego in check.<br>
Whole fucking world kept my ego in check.<br>
What the fuck are you gonna tell Congress, Keith? Huh?<br>
Beg them not to send me to prison?<br>
Hey.<br>
Hey, do you, do you remember back at Stonehill when they dared me to run that mile naked?<br>
Yeah, there was a crazy storm that night, you dumb shit.<br>
[LAUGHS] Fuck you, man.<br>
That was dope, man. I’m a legend over there.<br>
Everybody remembers that. Okay.<br>
They do, man. You don’t think people remember your four-minute, three-second mile? Oh.<br>
What is this, a pep talk?<br>
Motherfucker, stop hiding.<br>
Seriously. Okay?<br>
Stop being all meek and shit and running away.<br>
What, you want me to run through lightning with my dick out? Yeah.<br>
Please. Exactly that.<br>
Run through lightning with your dick out.<br>
Fuck it.<br>
[CROWD CLAMORING]<br>
[VEHICLE DOOR OPENS, CLOSES]<br>
You didn’t go to your mom’s?<br>
You took the car.<br>
[SIGHS] How was the run? Did it clear your head?<br>
Uh, Kev found me, brought me these.<br>
Mm. You guys talked?<br>
Yeah. He, uh, told me to run naked.<br>
You ran naked? No.<br>
Uh, it’s a metaphor.<br>
He’s saying I got to take this thing head-on.<br>
Well…<br>
Kind of like to see you run naked.<br>
[CROWD EXCLAIMING, SCREAMING]<br>
By the way, uh, WallStreetBets is back up.<br>
The motherfucker held. Holy shit.<br>
He lost $30 million, and he still fucking held.<br>
Robinhood’s back up. What?<br>
We got to get back in.<br>
Where’s the stock at right now? 109.<br>
Are you sure?<br>
That’s, like, all of the money that we made back into the stock.<br>
Yeah. We can’t let them get away with this.<br>
Fuck ’em.<br>
If he’s in, I’m in.<br>
If he’s in, I’m in.<br>
[SIGHS] Okay.<br>
Fuck!<br>
[BREATHES DEEPLY, LAUGHS]<br>
[BOTH YELLING]<br>
The frenzy continues with retail investors bidding back up GameStop.<br>
GameStop mania, it is back.<br>
NEWSWOMAN: Up more than 80%, as those message board traders simply send it higher.<br>
NEWSMAN: Stock volatility continuing, it looks like, this morning.<br>
Once again, GameStop involved in an ongoing battle between retail investors and short sellers.<br>
We’re gonna have a lot more on this story.<br>
NEWSWOMAN 2: CEOs of Robinhood, Reddit, Citadel and Melvin Capital, along with Keith Gill, better known as Roaring Kitty on social media, will be in the hot seat.<br>
GABE [VOICE-OVER]: I’m here testifying today far removed from my background.<br>
I grew up in a middle-class family in Portland, Maine.<br>
My dad was a grocery store executive.<br>
LAWYER: Maybe leave that part out.<br>
The part about my dad?<br>
The executive part.<br>
Okay. Okay.<br>
I went to a public high school.<br>
I studied hard and got into Northwestern.<br>
Upon… Just say “a good college.”<br>
I can’t say I went to Northwestern?<br>
Too elite. Northwestern’s too…<br>
All right.<br>
Upon graduation, I did not have a job.<br>
Today, I’m married with four children.<br>
Gabe, where do you plan on doing your testimony?<br>
Here.<br>
In front of your wine collection?<br>
I mean, this is… I don’t have that big a wine collection, honestly. Yeah, it’s huge.<br>
KEITH: …digital risks seemed to be overblown.<br>
Two, the negative sentiment was overdone.<br>
Three, the value was overwhelming.<br>
GABE: Maybe, uh, here would be nice?<br>
Too many windows. Too many wind– oh.<br>
It’s very bright.<br>
Yeah, oceanfronts, not a great idea.<br>
It’s blue. Yeah.<br>
Okay, I hadn’t thought of that. That, uh…<br>
Yeah, downstairs there’s more…<br>
There’s probably darker rooms.<br>
NEWSWOMAN: What a bandit.<br>
Most of you know this guy who was the Roaring Kitty character, who was really pushing it… Holy shit.<br>
Yo, Ri, our boy’s on the news.<br>
…and was it potentially a systemic risk?<br>
NEWSMAN: Those relationships in D.C. are strong.<br>
The guys who run those hedge funds are the guys who fund presidential campaigns.<br>
That’s a good point. You know, Roaring Kittys don’t have that kind of influence, but the hedge fund managers do.<br>
NEWSWOMAN 2: Gill is now being sued for securities fraud over his alleged role in the GameStop rally.<br>
NEWSMAN 2: Is Mr., uh, Gill likely to appear, and if he appears, is he likely to talk if he faces, uh, the potential of prosecution?<br>
The fundamentals are based on three things.<br>
One, the digital risks are overblown.<br>
Two, the negative sentiment is overdone.<br>
And three…<br>
Fuck. [KEVIN SNICKERS]<br>
Ah, come on. Shut up. I know all this.<br>
[KEVIN &amp; BRIGGSY LAUGHING]<br>
You guys, you guys, stop!<br>
Stop. Let’s keep going. All right, let’s go again.<br>
You’re right. This is serious. You can go to jail forever.<br>
A long time. Long, long time. All right. Ready?<br>
You ready? Here we go. Back in the game.<br>
Mr. Gill, Mr. Gill–<br>
May I call you Mr. Gill, sir? It’s my name.<br>
BRIGGSY: Why the fuck wouldn’t you be able to call him Mr. Gill?<br>
CAROLINE: What were your intentions with the YouTube videos and your social media posts on GameStop?<br>
Yes.<br>
KEITH: Thank you, Congresswoman.<br>
CAROLINE: You’re welcome. I developed a theory that the company was undervalued despite the significant short interests.<br>
Oh, so you were aware of the short interest?<br>
It is public knowledge.<br>
You can see it in the SEC filings.<br>
And your goal was to break these shorts, yes?<br>
To rally an online mob to artificially push the price of GameStop soaring, uh, “to the moon,” as they say?<br>
Isn’t that correct, Mr. Gill?<br>
Objection, objection! You’re leading the witness.<br>
Kev… I yield my time to the chair.<br>
You were hoping for the short squeeze, weren’t you, Mr. Gill?<br>
You short-squeezing bastard.<br>
The short squeeze was a marginal point of the thesis.<br>
BRIGGSY: Then why’d you talk about it in your videos all the time?<br>
KEVIN: You did talk about it in your videos.<br>
Uh-huh. You talked about it a lot.<br>
You remember about the squeeze? Exactly.<br>
You were like, “It’s just a little squeeze.”<br>
Exactly. And you’re really asking us to believe that you weren’t a leader to all these retail traders?<br>
You’re fucked, buddy.<br>
My point of view… Asking– Yes or no?<br>
KEVIN: Yes or no? Yes or no?<br>
BRIGGSY: Yes. So yes.<br>
You are admitting it. Yes. Yes or no?<br>
Remember you-you had the cheap bottle of champagne?<br>
Kevin! Kevin! You were dunking tendies in there like a fucking– What?<br>
I’m running with my dick out.<br>
Okay, why didn’t you just say that?<br>
Okay. I’ll stop. All right.<br>
[HIGH-PITCHED] Mr. Gill, what exactly about the fundamentals<br>
led you to build this bull case?<br>
BRIGGSY: What the fuck’s with the voice?<br>
[NORMAL VOICE] I don’t know. I was trying to do AOC, but it was flat.<br>
BRIGGSY: I don’t even think she’s on the panel.<br>
KEVIN: You shut the fuck up, Briggsy.<br>
I’ll slap the shit out of you. Is she on that panel?<br>
I swear to God. You’re gonna slap me?<br>
Yeah, let’s go. Let’s go. You ready to go?<br>
KEVIN: I’ve been waiting for this, dawg.<br>
[♪♪♪]<br>
[SIGHS]<br>
Come here.<br>
You’re gonna be great.<br>
If it goes bad, it’s gonna be real bad.<br>
Well, don’t let it go bad.<br>
MAXINE WATERS [VOICE-OVER]: This hearing will be the first in a series of hearings by the committee to examine the recent market volatility involving GameStop.<br>
I want to know how each of the witnesses here today contributed to the historic… Gabe, can you sit up?<br>
WATERS: …trading events in January.<br>
This recent market volatility has put a national spotlight on institutional practices by Wall Street firms.<br>
And they have demonstrated the enormous potential power of social media in our markets.<br>
We will hear firsthand from the witnesses regarding these events.<br>
The hearing will be an opportunity for this committee to get the facts about the role each of the witnesses represent played in the events we are examining today.<br>
JUAN VARGAS: Well, now, Mr. Griffin, if I could just ask you the first question? Of course.<br>
How many people are in the room with you?<br>
KEN: That’s your question?<br>
VARGAS: If you can just count how many people are in the room with you.<br>
KEN: There are five people, including myself, in this room.<br>
VARGAS: Did anyone in your organization…<br>
Prick. …since January 1st, contact Robinhood?<br>
We of course talk to Robinhood routinely in the ordinary course of business.<br>
We manage a substantial portion of their order flow.<br>
But did you talk to them about restricting or doing anything to prevent people from buying GameStop?<br>
I want to be perfectly clear.<br>
We had no role in Robinhood’s decision to limit trading in GameStop. Fuck you, Ken Griffin.<br>
VARGAS: So, if we depose everyone in your organization, we will find that?<br>
That is correct.<br>
Looks like a Disney Channel villain.<br>
AL LAWSON: Mr. Plotkin, do you believe that there is, uh, manipulation, distrust and overall inequality within American finance?<br>
My focus is on my company, Melvin…<br>
[VOLUME MUTED]<br>
KEVIN: Hello?<br>
You’re on mute, dick.<br>
Uh, I’m sorry. You’re on mute.<br>
[LAUGHTER]<br>
[VOLUME MUTED]<br>
STUDENT: He just keeps going.<br>
…my area of expertise.<br>
TAYLOR: You’re still on mute.<br>
I haven’t been able to hear a word you said, unfortunately.<br>
OCASIO-CORTEZ: Mr. Tenev, would you be willing to commit today to voluntarily pass on the proceeds…<br>
Ah. Marry me. …of the payment for order flow to Robinhood customers?<br>
Congresswoman, I appreciate that question.<br>
When the statement you refer to was made, it was before Robinhood forced the entire industry to drop commissions and replicate our…<br>
I should take that as a no.<br>
You’re not willing to pass on the proceeds of payment for order flow to your customers?<br>
When the other brokers drop… I’m just talking about today.<br>
[STUDENTS CLAMORING]<br>
Asshole! I don’t want to be rude.<br>
I just have limited time.<br>
Uh, but if removing the revenues that you make from a payment for order flow, uh, would cause the removal of free commissions, doesn’t that mean that trading on Robinhood isn’t actually free to begin with?<br>
[STUDENTS MURMURING] HARMONY: Good question.<br>
WATERS: Thank you very much, uh, Mr. Gill.<br>
You are now recognized for five minutes to present your oral testimony.<br>
[BREATHES DEEPLY]<br>
Thank you, members of the committee.<br>
I am happy to discuss my purchase of GameStop shares and my discussions of their fair value on social media.<br>
But before I do that, a few things I am not.<br>
I am not a cat.<br>
[SIGHS]<br>
What did he say?<br>
KEVIN: He just said “cat,” Ma.<br>
It’s like a, it’s like a Kitty thing.<br>
KEITH: Nor am I a hedge fund.<br>
I do not have clients, and I do not provide personalized investment advice for fees or commissions.<br>
I grew up in Brockton, Mass.<br>
My family was not wealthy.<br>
My father was a truck driver and my mom a registered nurse.<br>
KEVIN: That’s you, Ma!<br>
I was one of three kids and the first in my family to earn a four-year college degree when I graduated from Stonehill College in 2009.<br>
That was not a good time to be looking for a job.<br>
From 2010 to 2017, there were significant periods when I was unemployed.<br>
I took an interest in the stock market, and even though I had very little money, I used those times to educate myself and learn more about investing.<br>
Mr. Gill, I find it hard to believe that you predicted everything that happened to GameStop with no inside information.<br>
Uh, I didn’t predict it.<br>
I honestly couldn’t explain everything that happened in January.<br>
CONGRESSMAN: I’ve seen your videos.<br>
You honestly couldn’t recount to the committee what caused every single up and down of the stock in January?<br>
I think you could.<br>
Um, I did follow the stock, uh, very closely, but threshold lists, order flows, halting purchases– according to the press– these all had a material impact on the stock.<br>
Here’s the thing I-I have a bit of experience with this stuff, and even I barely understand these matters.<br>
It’s alarming how little we all know about the inner workings of the market.<br>
Which is why I’m glad this committee is examining what happened, particularly with the exorbitant short interest, as well as any potentially manipulative shorting practices and brokers’ reported failures to timely deliver shares and settle trades.<br>
A lot of people feel the system is broken.<br>
The whole idea of the stock market is to be, like, kind of a fair playing field, where if you’re smart and maybe with a little luck, you can make your fortune.<br>
But if it ever was that, it’s certainly not anymore.<br>
The big firms have such a big advantage in terms of technology and information and just sheer wealth, there’s no hope for the little guy anymore.<br>
Or there was no hope.<br>
Maybe now there is.<br>
And as for me, I like the stock.<br>
[CHEERING]<br>
He’s gangster for that.<br>
And I don’t plan on selling anytime soon.<br>
MAN: Hold it! Hold it! Say that shit.<br>
Diamond fucking hand.<br>
Diamond hands, baby.<br>
Attaboy.<br>
What a nerd.<br>
Thank you.<br>
[EXHALING HEAVILY]<br>
It was good.<br>
I think.<br>
NEWSMAN: Yesterday’s Reddit hearing in Congress brought together some of the power players behind the January trading frenzy.<br>
NEWSWOMAN: Representative Maxine Waters did say that there will be, uh, additional hearings on this and there will be two more to follow to find more answers…<br>
NEWSMAN 2: Ultimately, whether it’s markets or social media– or I’ll just call it media, ’cause that’s what it is now– do you think any new regulation gets done?<br>
NEWSMAN 3: What’s clear is that we’re in the Wild West and that there is so much activity that’s going on on these online forums.<br>
And we’ve seen in the last month, in the last six weeks, how much force day traders en masse can bring to the market and actually affect it.<br>
They used to just make some noise around the edges.<br>
Now they can actually move markets and move securities.<br>

Hey, man, I noticed you’ve been selling a lot of new games, and I just want to remind you again that we really want to be pushing customers towards the higher margin pre-owned games.<br>
Yeah, I’m not gonna do that.<br>
Excuse me?<br>
Oh, and in fact, I’m not gonna do any of the “Circle of Life” bullshit or your TikTok dance contest.<br>
You’re quitting, then?<br>
Okay.<br>
Nah, I mean, I-I thought about it, but…<br>
like, yo, I love it here.<br>
So I think I’m-a stay.<br>
Oh, you’re awfully smug for a kid who lost all his money buying stock.<br>
What’d you say it was going to? A thousand?<br>
I’m also not gonna work at the ass crack of dawn anymore.<br>
