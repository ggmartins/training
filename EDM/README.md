Customers are able to streamline front, middle and back office operations and create
consistent versions of data in a fully audited and transparent environment.
The transparency of where data has come from, who has touched it, what rules were applied is ensured by EDMâ€™s data lineage. 
```

* Data governance: Creates a single version of the truth, data stewardship of data assets and a transparent audit trail.
* Data quality: Data is validated, enriched and reconciled across multiple sources reducing operational risk.
* Data transparency: Data lineage provides look through hierarchy and side by side source comparisons.
* Data integration: Internal and external data silos can be eliminated. Legacy applications and systems can be consolidated.
* Data dissemination: Data can be aggregated and presented in the right format at the right time as needed by each business
