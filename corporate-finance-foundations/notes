Finance
- Deciding what things to BUY and NOT TO BUY
- Getting the money to buy the things you decided you need
- Efficiently manage the resources that you have

- What to buy?
- Where to get the money you need to buy?
- Manage it once you have it.

Finance is about risk and the benefits of diversification
Finance is about a company's capital structure

CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL

Risk-free Rate + (Equity risk premium x)

= Expected Return


Accounting and Finance are two side of same coin
- Where the money comes from
- Where the money is used for
- Where the money is going

Board Strategic Focus (Board Quarterly Meetings)
- Inventory management (consumer products company_
  - inventory can lose value rapidly as consumer tastes changes)
- Aquisitions - the company frequently expanded by buying other companies (strategically evaluate new resources)
  - What new products and what new markets we're adding to the existing mix
- Borrowing Policy - Loans - credit line with a bank, pre-approved loan to a certain amount
- Share Buyback - focused on potentially buy back shares
- Large Institutional Investors - interested in the investors - who they are? (pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds)
(until privaty equity took over and bought all the shares, from all other investors)

The Board talked about FINANCE

- Deciding what you need to buy
- Determine what you get the money to buy
- Manage the assets you bought

What you need to buy?
- Long term (infrastructure - land, building?)
- Short term (how much cash you need? inventory, operational costs, staffing, marketing, etc.)
  (let the customers by on credit?)
How to Get the Money to buy the things I need?
- Borrow
- Shareholders
- Internal Generated Profits
How do I manage the resources once I have them?
- Scheduling
- Budget
- Control / Process / Procedures

Board is usually focused on:
How to Get the Money to buy the things I need?
- Outsiders, do they want to invest on our company or somewhere else?

Company <---- Financial Institutions ----> Investors

Finance is much larger than this part alone!

Finance - Matching:
- Parties who need money
- Parties who have money

Entrepreneurs 
- People and Organizations with ideas and objectives

Investors
- Individuals and companies ready to loan or invest others

Facilitator
- Match Entrepreneurs with Investors

Investors
- Looking for investments opportunities
  - What circustances they should provide money to entrepreneurs?
  - Should they lend money?
  - Should they invest money?
  - Different Risks and Returns on the choices made here.
investors's portifolio of investments? probably not all-in in a single big investment

Facilitators:
- Banks
- Mutual Funds
- Private Equity firms
- Insurance Companies
- Investment Banks

Facilitators bring together those who need money, with those who have money.

Finance looks at the ecosystem and sees how they interact with each other.
But it's more than that.

Risk: Uncertainty about what will happen in the future.

"People need to be paid to accept RISK"

savings account < 1% returns
bonds ~4% returns
index funds ~10% returns

Future: variability of possible outcomes
- it can go well

Risk in Finance:
- Reducing Risk
- Eliminating Risk
- Pricing Risk

Risk is the likelihood of a BAD OUTCOME:
- Any step forward involves the risk of things not going as planned
- Some risks can't be avoided (car insurance companies, price the risk into the premiums they charge)
- Some risks can be avoided (duo diligence, history background check)

The concept of DIVERSIFICATION ASSISTS COMPANIES AND INVESTORS in MANAGING RISKS
DIVERSIFICATION is just a way of saying: don't put all of your eggs in one basket.

Diversification financial assets
Diversification of products (Apple example: phones, tablets, computers, cloud services)

DIVERSIFICATION reduces RISK

Work to REDUCE risk or PRICE risk:

Risk that you can't do NOTHING about is called BETA risk,
Beta Risk - Measures the Market-Wide risk that cannot be
eliminated through diversification because it happens to
everybody.

CAPM
- Investors are Risk averse, so you have to pay them to accept risk.
- Some risks can be eliminated through diversification.
- Beta Risk - cannot be eliminated through diversification
  
  (Beta)  bp = Cov(rp, rb)  (Company's return and Market's returns)
           -----------
             Var(rb)    (Variance of Market Return)

If you CAN'T ELIMINATE that risk, it needs to be PRICED

Beta helps measuring the higher expected return.

Cash has a beta (b) of zero.

1 dollar bill (disregard inflation and foreign currency fluctuation)
investment in the dollar bill is immune to fluctuation in broad economic forces,

If Market is UP 15%, My Portifolio is also UP 15%, that means Beta = 1

Home building industry has a beta of > 1. When the economy goes HOT, home builders get RED HOT.
When the economy cools, the home building gets "downright cold".
Little movements in the broader economy result in a big movement in the house-building economy.

That's reflected mathematically, home building with Beta > 1.
Beta measures Market-Wide risk (you cannot manage), used as one important input in
measuring an investment's expected return.

QUESTION: What companies or financial assets are considered to have a negative Beta?
QUESTION: Does gold have a negative beta or a beta close to zero?

Risk-free Rate

The return an investor would expect from absolute risk-free investment over a specific
period of time.
For a given level of risk, what is the expected return OVER AND ABOVE the RISK-FREE RATE (The baseline)
an investor require?

Lenmoney to the most trustworthy organization on the planet -> (at least) build the inflation into the
interest rate charged. Time: a dollar now worth more than a dollar 1 year from now.

Risk-Free Rate (Benchmark / Baseline) = Expected Inflation + Time Value of Money
* it's not the same over time and not the same over individual country
* forecasted inflation
(Normally at 5% worldwide (a year?) if inflation is higher it will be > 5%)
(Can go to 15% as shown by the history)

Equity Investment (Shares) higher returns = higher risk
* Returns > Risk-Free Rate, therefore needs to have a premium associated with it
Equity Risk Premium -> Extra amount you expect to earn on your investment bc you're investing in risky assets
Stock investing (over many years in US) = 10% - 11% a year.
Stock investing - Risk-Free Rate = Equity Risk Premium
11% - 5% = 6%
Evaluating Alternative Investments needs to be benchmarked against Risk-Free Rate and Equity Investments

Netflix Expected Returns (CAPM)
Risk-Free Rate + (Equity Risk Premium * Beta Risk)
5% + (6% * 1.58) = 5% + 9.5% = 14.5%
NOTE: Get the updated list of Estimated Beta for companies)

Walmart (CAPM)
Risk-Free Rate + (Equity Risk Premium * Beta Risk)
5% + (6% * 1.58) = 5% + 3.2% = 8.2%

CAPITAL STRUCTURE: The mix between owner investment and long-term borrowing
The video discusses how the mix of borrowing and owner investment is used to finance an asset
(like a house or a company) impacts its value.
Risk and Tax Implications: A smaller mortgage reduces the risk of financial distress,
while a larger mortgage can provide tax benefits through interest deductions
("If you can't make the mortgage payments, eventually you'll lose the house").
Impact on Value: The total value of an asset can be influenced by how it is financed, highlighting the importance of capital structure in corporate finance.

These points illustrate the balance between risk and benefits in financing decisions, which is crucial in corporate finance.

Does CAPITAL STRUCTURE impact the value of the company? (Important for Corporate Finance)
- in a "perfect world", no
- in the real world: YES, when there are cost and friction
With income tax being a KEY FACTOR

Investment Method: Loans of $200M
Payments to Lender Considered: Interest (Interest Expense)
Tax Deductible: YES

Investment Method: Owning invests $200M
Payments to Lender Considered: Dividends
Tax Deductible: NO

"Too much debt (increases the pressure for performance) -> Too much interest -> Doesn't allow the company to slip (company bankruptcy)"
Bankruptcy -> Costly due to legal fees

////////////////////////////
OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE -> Some borrowing (but not too much because of the risk of financial distress) -> Tax Deduction
////////////////////////////

Here are the key takeaways from the video "Factors influencing optimal capital structure":

Income Tax Rates: Higher tax rates encourage more borrowing due to larger tax deductions for interest payments.
(Cheap Loans -> More borrowing)
Quality of Collateral: Companies with good collateral (e.g., buildings, physical infrastructure) are likelier to borrow more
(banks are more open to lending money for good collateral),
while those with poor collateral (e.g., salaries, tech) borrow less.
Stability of Cash Flows: Businesses with stable and predictable cash flows can afford to borrow more,
whereas those with volatile cash flows should borrow less.

These factors help determine the optimal mix of debt and equity for a company's capital structure.

Walmart vs Google
- Walmart: 35% financing provided by owner investors / 65% financing from loan
- Google: 75% financing provided by owner investors / 25% financing from loan

---> There's an **Optimal Capital Structure** for each company profile (level of company's leverage) <---

Cost of Capital -> Cost of obtaining financing (Cost of borrowing + Cost of equity investment)
Higher Cost of Capital = Increased Risk of Cost of Operations = Higher Required Return by investors

Cost of Capital = Interest Rate on Loans
Cost of Equity Investment (Necessary Expected Return) --> USE CAPM
- Which projects get funded
- Which projects don't (Cost of Capital is higher than the money generated by the project (projected cash flow))

Lily needs $200 million to pursue her dreams. Case one, simple capital structure, 100% debt financing.
Lily borrows the entire $200 million. Potential lenders look at this and demand an interest rate of 12%.
In other words, the lenders give you $200 million now, and at the end of one year,
you need to give them back $200 million plus 12%. That's $224 million.
Now, let's look at the projected cash flow that will be generated by this ice cream business that creates
lots of strawberry ice cream. The cash flows are only going to be $220 million. From the standpoint of the lenders,
if this project is only going to generate $220 million in cash flow, it's no good.

... So this capital structure doesn't work. Let's try something else, case two. 100% equity financing.
Lily finds investors who will provide the $200 million as an investment, not a loan.
These investors have used the capital asset pricing model and are demanding an expected return of 15%.
In other words, at the end of one year, there has to be $230 million available to give to the investors.
Now, why is this 15% equity financing return higher than the 12% interest rate in the 100% debt financing scenario?
It is because debt financing is supported, and protected by the laws of every country in the world.
If you loan money to a company,

Now, why is this 15% equity financing return higher than the 12% interest rate in the 100% debt
financing scenario? It is because debt financing is supported, and protected by the laws of every country in the world.
If you loan money to a company, the law is on your side if the company doesn't pay you back.
If Lily can't pay back a $200 million loan, the lenders go to the courts,
and the courts will allow the lenders to go in and take Lily's assets and do whatever they can to get their money back.

Cost of Capital: It is the cost of obtaining external financing, combining the cost of borrowing and the cost of equity investment.
It determines which projects are profitable and worth pursuing.
Debt vs. Equity Financing: Debt financing involves borrowing money at an interest rate,
while equity financing involves investors expecting a return. Debt is generally cheaper due to legal protections for lenders,
whereas equity is riskier and demands higher returns.
Project Viability: The cost of capital helps decide which projects to fund. Projects with returns higher than the cost of capital
are good investments, while those with lower returns are not.

Here are the key takeaways from the video "Cost of capital: Split debt-equity financing":

Mix of Financing: Combining debt and equity financing can balance the cost of capital.
For example, a 50/50 split between debt and equity has different implications than a 90/10 split.
Risk and Return: Equity investors require a higher return due to higher risk, as they are paid after lenders.
Lenders have a priority claim, making their position less risky but still influenced by the amount of equity cushion.
Project Viability: The right mix of debt and equity can lower the total cost of capital, making a project feasible.
For instance, a mix that results in a cost of capital lower than the expected cash flows can make a project viable.

These points highlight how the balance between debt and equity affects the overall cost of capital and project success.


90% Debt, 10% Equity
Lenders: $180 million + 8% ir = $194 million
Investors: $20 million  + 18% ir = $24 million

QUESTION: Why do we even need investors when you have a loan at such a lower IR?
////////////////////////
WACC: Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
////////////////////////

Here are the key takeaways from the video "Weighted-average cost of capital":

Calculation of WACC: The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is calculated by averaging
the costs of debt and equity financing, weighted by their respective proportions in the capital structure.
Project Evaluation: Companies use WACC to evaluate the attractiveness of various projects.
If the expected return on a project is higher than the WACC, the project is considered good.
Optimal Capital Structure: Finding the optimal mix of debt and equity financing can minimize WACC,
allowing for more attractive projects. For example, a 90% debt and 10% equity mix might provide the lowest WACC.

These points illustrate how WACC is used to determine the cost of financing and evaluate potential projects.

10.5% WACC vc 10% Expected Operating Return (NO GOOD)

A company making containers takes out a one-year loan of $75 million at an interest rate of 8 percent,
to accomplish a facility refurbishment.
What is the minimum amount the project needs to return at the end of the year?
75M * (1.0 * 0.08) = 75M + 6M = 81M
QUESTION: What about Risk-Free Rate?
