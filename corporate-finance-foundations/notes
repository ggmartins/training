Finance
- Deciding what things to BUY and NOT TO BUY
- Getting the money to buy the things you decided you need
- Efficiently manage the resources that you have

- What to buy?
- Where to get the money you need to buy?
- Manage it once you have it.

Finance is about risk and the benefits of diversification
Finance is about a company's capital structure

CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL

Risk-free Rate + (Equity risk premium x)
------------
= Expected Return


Accounting and Finance are two side of same coin
- Where the money comes from
- Where the money is used for
- Where the money is going

Board Strategic Focus (Board Quarterly Meetings)
- Inventory management (consumer products company_
  - inventory can lose value rapidly as consumer tastes changes)
- Aquisitions - the company frequently expanded by buying other companies (strategically evaluate new resources)
  - What new products and what new markets we're adding to the existing mix
- Borrowing Policy - Loans - credit line with a bank, pre-approved loan to a certain amount
- Share Buyback - focused on potentially buy back shares
- Large Institutional Investors - interested in the investors - who they are? (pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds)
(until privaty equity took over and bought all the shares, from all other investors)

The Board talked about FINANCE

- Deciding what you need to buy
- Determine what you get the money to buy
- Manage the assets you bought

What you need to buy?
- Long term (infrastructure - land, building?)
- Short term (how much cash you need? inventory, operational costs, staffing, marketing, etc.)
  (let the customers by on credit?)
How to Get the Money to buy the things I need?
- Borrow
- Shareholders
- Internal Generated Profits
How do I manage the resources once I have them?
- Scheduling
- Budget
- Control / Process / Procedures

Board is usually focused on:
How to Get the Money to buy the things I need?
- Outsiders, do they want to invest on our company or somewhere else?

Company <---- Financial Institutions ----> Investors

Finance is much larger than this part alone!

Finance - Matching:
- Parties who need money
- Parties who have money

Entrepreneurs 
- People and Organizations with ideas and objectives

Investors
- Individuals and companies ready to loan or invest others

Facilitator
- Match Entrepreneurs with Investors

Investors
- Looking for investments opportunities
  - What circustances they should provide money to entrepreneurs?
  - Should they lend money?
  - Should they invest money?
  - Different Risks and Returns on the choices made here.
investors's portifolio of investments? probably not all-in in a single big investment

Facilitators:
- Banks
- Mutual Funds
- Private Equity firms
- Insurance Companies
- Investment Banks

Facilitators bring together those who need money, with those who have money.

Finance looks at the ecosystem and sees how they interact with each other.
But it's more than that.

Risk: Uncertainty about what will happen in the future.

"People need to be paid to accept RISK"

savings account < 1% returns
bonds ~4% returns
index funds ~10% returns

Future: variability of possible outcomes
- it can go well

Risk in Finance:
- Reducing Risk
- Eliminating Risk
- Pricing Risk

Risk is the likelihood of a BAD OUTCOME:
- Any step forward involves the risk of things not going as planned
- Some risks can't be avoided (car insurance companies, price the risk into the premiums they charge)
- Some risks can be avoided (duo diligence, history background check)

The concept of DIVERSIFICATION ASSISTS COMPANIES AND INVESTORS in MANAGING RISKS
DIVERSIFICATION is just a way of saying: don't put all of your eggs in one basket.

Diversification financial assets
Diversification of products (Apple example: phones, tablets, computers, cloud services)

DIVERSIFICATION reduces RISK

Work to REDUCE risk or PRICE risk:

Risk that you can't do NOTHING about is called BETA risk,
Beta Risk - Measures the Market-Wide risk that cannot be
eliminated through diversification because it happens to
everybody.

CAPM
- Investors are Risk averse, so you have to pay them to accept risk.
- Some risks can be eliminated through diversification.
- Beta Risk - cannot be eliminated through diversification
  
  (Beta)  bp = Cov(rp, rb)  (Company's return and Market's returns)
           -----------
             Var(rb)    (Variance of Market Return)

If you CAN'T ELIMINATE that risk, it needs to be PRICED

Beta helps measuring the higher expected return.

Cash has a beta (b) of zero.

1 dollar bill (disregard inflation and foreign currency fluctuation)
investment in the dollar bill is immune to fluctuation in broad economic forces,

If Market is UP 15%, My Portifolio is also UP 15%, that means Beta = 1

Home building industry has a beta of > 1. When the economy goes HOT, home builders get RED HOT.
When the economy cools, the home building gets "downright cold".
Little movements in the broader economy result in a big movement in the house-building economy.

That's reflected mathematically, home building with Beta > 1.
Beta measures Market-Wide risk (you cannot manage), used as one important input in
measuring an investment's expected return.

QUESTION: What companies or financial assets are considered to have a negative Beta?
QUESTION: Does gold have a negative beta or a beta close to zero?

Risk-free Rate

The return an investor would expect from absolute risk-free investment over a specific
period of time.
For a given level of risk, what is the expected return OVER AND ABOVE the RISK-FREE RATE (The baseline)
an investor require?

Lenmoney to the most trustworthy organization on the planet -> (at least) build the inflation into the
interest rate charged. Time: a dollar now worth more than a dollar 1 year from now.

Risk-Free Rate (Benchmark / Baseline) = Expected Inflation + Time Value of Money
* it's not the same over time and not the same over individual country
* forecasted inflation
(Normally at 5% worldwide (a year?) if inflation is higher it will be > 5%)
(Can go to 15% as shown by the history)

Equity Investment (Shares) higher returns = higher risk
* Returns > Risk-Free Rate, therefore needs to have a premium associated with it
Equity Risk Premium -> Extra amount you expect to earn on your investment bc you're investing in risky assets
Stock investing (over many years in US) = 10% - 11% a year.
Stock investing - Risk-Free Rate = Equity Risk Premium
11% - 5% = 6%
Evaluating Alternative Investments needs to be benchmarked against Risk-Free Rate and Equity Investments

Netflix Expected Returns (CAPM)
Risk-Free Rate + (Equity Risk Premium * Beta Risk)
5% + (6% * 1.58) = 5% + 9.5% = 14.5%
NOTE: Get the updated list of Estimated Beta for companies)

Walmart (CAPM)
Risk-Free Rate + (Equity Risk Premium * Beta Risk)
5% + (6% * 1.58) = 5% + 3.2% = 8.2%
//////////////////////////
CAPM -> Return on investment should be greater than the risk-free rate plus an <asset name here> risk premium.

CAPITAL STRUCTURE: The mix between owner investment and long-term borrowing
The video discusses how the mix of borrowing and owner investment is used to finance an asset
(like a house or a company) impacts its value.
Risk and Tax Implications: A smaller mortgage reduces the risk of financial distress,
while a larger mortgage can provide tax benefits through interest deductions
("If you can't make the mortgage payments, eventually you'll lose the house").
Impact on Value: The total value of an asset can be influenced by how it is financed, highlighting the importance of capital structure in corporate finance.

These points illustrate the balance between risk and benefits in financing decisions, which is crucial in corporate finance.

Does CAPITAL STRUCTURE impact the value of the company? (Important for Corporate Finance)
- in a "perfect world", no
- in the real world: YES, when there are cost and friction
With income tax being a KEY FACTOR

Investment Method: Loans of $200M
Payments to Lender Considered: Interest (Interest Expense)
Tax Deductible: YES

Investment Method: Owning invests $200M
Payments to Lender Considered: Dividends
Tax Deductible: NO

"Too much debt (increases the pressure for performance) -> Too much interest -> Doesn't allow the company to slip (company bankruptcy)"
Bankruptcy -> Costly due to legal fees

////////////////////////////
OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE -> Some borrowing (but not too much because of the risk of financial distress) -> Tax Deduction
