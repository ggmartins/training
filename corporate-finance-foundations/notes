Finance
- Deciding what things to BUY and NOT TO BUY
- Getting the money to buy the things you decided you need
- Efficiently manage the resources that you have

- What to buy?
- Where to get the money you need to buy?
- Manage it once you have it.

Finance is about risk and the benefits of diversification
Finance is about a company's capital structure

CAPITAL ASSET PRICING MODEL

Risk-free Rate + (Equity risk premium x)
------------
= Expected Return


Accounting and Finance are two side of same coin
- Where the money comes from
- Where the money is used for
- Where the money is going

Board Strategic Focus (Board Quarterly Meetings)
- Inventory management (consumer products company_
  - inventory can lose value rapidly as consumer tastes changes)
- Aquisitions - the company frequently expanded by buying other companies (strategically evaluate new resources)
  - What new products and what new markets we're adding to the existing mix
- Borrowing Policy - Loans - credit line with a bank, pre-approved loan to a certain amount
- Share Buyback - focused on potentially buy back shares
- Large Institutional Investors - interested in the investors - who they are? (pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds)
(until privaty equity took over and bought all the shares, from all other investors)

The Board talked about FINANCE

- Deciding what you need to buy
- Determine what you get the money to buy
- Manage the assets you bought

What you need to buy?
- Long term (infrastructure - land, building?)
- Short term (how much cash you need? inventory, operational costs, staffing, marketing, etc.)
  (let the customers by on credit?)
How to Get the Money to buy the things I need?
- Borrow
- Shareholders
- Internal Generated Profits
How do I manage the resources once I have them?
- Scheduling
- Budget
- Control / Process / Procedures

Board is usually focused on:
How to Get the Money to buy the things I need?
- Outsiders, do they want to invest on our company or somewhere else?

Company <---- Financial Institutions ----> Investors

Finance is much larger than this part alone!

Finance - Matching:
- Parties who need money
- Parties who have money

Entrepreneurs 
- People and Organizations with ideas and objectives

Investors
- Individuals and companies ready to loan or invest others

Facilitator
- Match Entrepreneurs with Investors

Investors
- Looking for investments opportunities
  - What circustances they should provide money to entrepreneurs?
  - Should they lend money?
  - Should they invest money?
  - Different Risks and Returns on the choices made here.
investors's portifolio of investments? probably not all-in in a single big investment

Facilitators:
- Banks
- Mutual Funds
- Private Equity firms
- Insurance Companies
- Investment Banks

Facilitators bring together those who need money, with those who have money.

Finance look at the ecosystem and see how they interact with each other.
But it's more than that.

Risk: Uncertainty about what will happen in the future.

Future: variability of possible outcomes
- it can go well

Risk in Finance:
- Reducing Risk
- Eliminating Risk
- Pricing Risk

Risk is the likelihood of a BAD OUTCOME:
- Any step forward involve risk of things not going as planned
- Some risks can't be avoided (car insurance companies)
- Some risks can be avoided (duo deligence, history background check)

The concept of DIVERSIFICATION ASSISTS COMPANIES AND INVESTORS in MANAGING RISKS
DIVERSIFICATION is just a way of saying: don't put all of your eggs in one basket.

Work to REDUCE risk or PRICE risk:

Risk that you can't do NOTHING about is called BETA risk,
Beta Risk - Measures the Market-Wide risk that cannot be
eliminated through diversification because it happens to
everybody.

CAPM
- Investors are Risk averse, so you have to pay them to accept risk.
- Some risks can be eliminated to through diversification.
- Beta Risk - cannot be eliminated through diversification
  
  bp = Cov(rp, rb)  (Company's return and Market's returns)
       -----------
         Var(rb)    (Variance of Market Return)

If you can't eliminate that risk, it needs to be priced

Beta helps measuring the higher expected return.

Cash has a beta (b) of zero.

1 dollar bill (disregard inflation and foreign currency fluctuation)
investment in the dollar bill is immune to fluctuation in broad economic forces,

If Market is UP 15%, My Portifolio is also UP 15%, that means Beta == 1

Home building industry has a beta of > 1. When economy goes HOT, home builders get RED HOT.
When economy cools, the home building gets "downright cold".
Little movements in the broader economy results in a big movement in the house building economy.

That's reflect mathematically, home building with Beta > 1.
Beta measures Market-Wide risk (you cannot manage), used as one important input in
measuring an investment expected return.
