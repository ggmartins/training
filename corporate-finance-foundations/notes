Finance
- Deciding what things to BUY and NOT TO BUY
- Getting the money to buy the things you decided you need
- Efficiently manage the resources that you have

- What to buy?
- Where to get the money you need to buy?
- Manage it once you have it.

Finance is about risk and the benefits of diversification
Finance is about a company's capital structure

Accounting and Finance are two side of same coin
- Where the money comes from
- Where the money is used for
- Where the money is going

Board Strategic Focus (Board Quarterly Meetings)
- Inventory management (consumer products company_
  - inventory can lose value rapidly as consumer tastes changes)
- Aquisitions - the company frequently expanded by buying other companies (strategically evaluate new resources)
  - What new products and what new markets we're adding to the existing mix
- Borrowing Policy - Loans - credit line with a bank, pre-approved loan to a certain amount
- Share Buyback - focused on potentially buy back shares
- Large Institutional Investors - interested in the investors - who they are? (pension funds, insurance companies, mutual funds)
(until privaty equity took over and bought all the shares, from all other investors)

The Board talked about FINANCE

- Deciding what you need to buy
- Determine what you get the money to buy
- Manage the assets you bought

What you need to buy?
- Long term (infrastructure - land, building?)
- Short term (how much cash you need? inventory, operational costs, staffing, marketing, etc.)
  (let the customers by on credit?)
How to Get the Money to buy the things I need?
- Borrow
- Shareholders
- Internal Generated Profits
How do I manage the resources once I have them?
- Scheduling
- Budget
- Control / Process / Procedures

Board is usually focused on:
How to Get the Money to buy the things I need?
- Outsiders, do they want to invest on our company or somewhere else?

Company <---- Financial Institutions ----> Investors

Finance is much larger than this part alone!

Finance - Matching:
- Parties who need money
- Parties who have money

Entrepreneurs 
- People and Organizations with ideas and objectives

Investors
- Individuals and companies ready to loan or invest others

Facilitator
- Match Entrepreneurs with Investors

Investors
- Looking for investments opportunities
  - What circustances they should provide money to entrepreneurs?
  - Should they lend money?
  - Should they invest money?
  - Different Risks and Returns on the choices made here.
investors's portifolio of investments? probably not all-in in a single big investment

Facilitators:

Facilitators bring together those who need money, with those who have money.

Finance looks at the ecosystem and sees how they interact with each other.
But it's more than that.

Risk: Uncertainty about what will happen in the future.

"People need to be paid to accept RISK"

savings account < 1% returns
bonds ~4% returns
index funds ~10% returns

Future: variability of possible outcomes
- it can go well

Risk in Finance:
- Reducing Risk
- Eliminating Risk
- Pricing Risk

Risk is the likelihood of a BAD OUTCOME:
- Any step forward involves the risk of things not going as planned
- Some risks can't be avoided (car insurance companies, price the risk into the premiums they charge)
- Some risks can be avoided (duo diligence, history background check)

The concept of DIVERSIFICATION ASSISTS COMPANIES AND INVESTORS in MANAGING RISKS
DIVERSIFICATION is just a way of saying: don't put all of your eggs in one basket.

Diversification financial assets
Diversification of products (Apple example: phones, tablets, computers, cloud services)

DIVERSIFICATION reduces RISK

Work to REDUCE risk or PRICE risk:

Risk that you can't do NOTHING about is called BETA risk,
Beta Risk - Measures the Market-Wide risk that cannot be
eliminated through diversification because it happens to
everybody.

CAPM
- Investors are Risk averse, so you have to pay them to accept risk.
- Some risks can be eliminated through diversification.
- Beta Risk - cannot be eliminated through diversification
  
  (Beta)  bp = Cov(rp, rb)  (Company's return and Market's returns)
           -----------
             Var(rb)    (Variance of Market Return)

If you CAN'T ELIMINATE that risk, it needs to be PRICED

Beta helps measuring the higher expected return.

Cash has a beta (b) of zero.

1 dollar bill (disregard inflation and foreign currency fluctuation)
investment in the dollar bill is immune to fluctuation in broad economic forces,

If Market is UP 15%, My Portifolio is also UP 15%, that means Beta = 1

Home building industry has a beta of > 1. When the economy goes HOT, home builders get RED HOT.
When the economy cools, the home building gets "downright cold".
Little movements in the broader economy result in a big movement in the house-building economy.

That's reflected mathematically, home building with Beta > 1.
Beta measures Market-Wide risk (you cannot manage), used as one important input in
measuring an investment's expected return.

QUESTION: What companies or financial assets are considered to have a negative Beta?
QUESTION: Does gold have a negative beta or a beta close to zero?

Risk-free Rate

The return an investor would expect from absolute risk-free investment over a specific
period of time.
For a given level of risk, what is the expected return OVER AND ABOVE the RISK-FREE RATE (The baseline)
an investor require?

Lenmoney to the most trustworthy organization on the planet -> (at least) build the inflation into the
interest rate charged. Time: a dollar now worth more than a dollar 1 year from now.

Risk-Free Rate (Benchmark / Baseline) = Expected Inflation + Time Value of Money
* it's not the same over time and not the same over individual country
* forecasted inflation
(Normally at 5% worldwide (a year?) if inflation is higher it will be > 5%)
(Can go to 15% as shown by the history)

Equity Investment (Shares) higher returns = higher risk
* Returns > Risk-Free Rate, therefore needs to have a premium associated with it
Equity Risk Premium -> Extra amount you expect to earn on your investment bc you're investing in risky assets
Stock investing (over many years in US) = 10% - 11% a year.
Stock investing - Risk-Free Rate = Equity Risk Premium
11% - 5% = 6%
Evaluating Alternative Investments needs to be benchmarked against Risk-Free Rate and Equity Investments

Netflix Expected Returns (CAPM)
Risk-Free Rate + (Equity Risk Premium * Beta Risk)
5% + (6% * 1.58) = 5% + 9.5% = 14.5%
NOTE: Get the updated list of Estimated Beta for companies)

Walmart (CAPM)
Risk-Free Rate + (Equity Risk Premium * Beta Risk)
5% + (6% * 1.58) = 5% + 3.2% = 8.2%

CAPITAL STRUCTURE: The mix between owner investment and long-term borrowing
The video discusses how the mix of borrowing and owner investment is used to finance an asset
(like a house or a company) impacts its value.
Risk and Tax Implications: A smaller mortgage reduces the risk of financial distress,
while a larger mortgage can provide tax benefits through interest deductions
("If you can't make the mortgage payments, eventually you'll lose the house").
Impact on Value: The total value of an asset can be influenced by how it is financed, highlighting the importance of capital structure in corporate finance.

These points illustrate the balance between risk and benefits in financing decisions, which is crucial in corporate finance.

Does CAPITAL STRUCTURE impact the value of the company? (Important for Corporate Finance)
- in a "perfect world", no
- in the real world: YES, when there are cost and friction
With income tax being a KEY FACTOR

Investment Method: Loans of $200M
Payments to Lender Considered: Interest (Interest Expense)
Tax Deductible: YES

Investment Method: Owning invests $200M
Payments to Lender Considered: Dividends
Tax Deductible: NO

"Too much debt (increases the pressure for performance) -> Too much interest -> Doesn't allow the company to slip (company bankruptcy)"
Bankruptcy -> Costly due to legal fees

////////////////////////////
OPTIMAL CAPITAL STRUCTURE -> Some borrowing (but not too much because of the risk of financial distress) -> Tax Deduction
////////////////////////////

Here are the key takeaways from the video "Factors influencing optimal capital structure":

Income Tax Rates: Higher tax rates encourage more borrowing due to larger tax deductions for interest payments.
(Cheap Loans -> More borrowing)
Quality of Collateral: Companies with good collateral (e.g., buildings, physical infrastructure) are likelier to borrow more
(banks are more open to lending money for good collateral),
while those with poor collateral (e.g., salaries, tech) borrow less.
Stability of Cash Flows: Businesses with stable and predictable cash flows can afford to borrow more,
whereas those with volatile cash flows should borrow less.

These factors help determine the optimal mix of debt and equity for a company's capital structure.

Walmart vs Google
- Walmart: 35% financing provided by owner investors / 65% financing from loan
- Google: 75% financing provided by owner investors / 25% financing from loan

---> There's an **Optimal Capital Structure** for each company profile (level of company's leverage) <---

Cost of Capital -> Cost of obtaining financing (Cost of borrowing + Cost of equity investment)
Higher Cost of Capital = Increased Risk of Cost of Operations = Higher Required Return by investors

Cost of Capital = Interest Rate on Loans
Cost of Equity Investment (Necessary Expected Return) --> USE CAPM
- Which projects get funded
- Which projects don't (Cost of Capital is higher than the money generated by the project (projected cash flow))

Lily needs $200 million to pursue her dreams. Case one, simple capital structure, 100% debt financing.
Lily borrows the entire $200 million. Potential lenders look at this and demand an interest rate of 12%.
In other words, the lenders give you $200 million now, and at the end of one year,
you need to give them back $200 million plus 12%. That's $224 million.
Now, let's look at the projected cash flow that will be generated by this ice cream business that creates
lots of strawberry ice cream. The cash flows are only going to be $220 million. From the standpoint of the lenders,
if this project is only going to generate $220 million in cash flow, it's no good.

... So this capital structure doesn't work. Let's try something else, case two. 100% equity financing.
Lily finds investors who will provide the $200 million as an investment, not a loan.
These investors have used the capital asset pricing model and are demanding an expected return of 15%.
In other words, at the end of one year, there has to be $230 million available to give to the investors.
Now, why is this 15% equity financing return higher than the 12% interest rate in the 100% debt financing scenario?
It is because debt financing is supported, and protected by the laws of every country in the world.
If you loan money to a company,

Now, why is this 15% equity financing return higher than the 12% interest rate in the 100% debt
financing scenario? It is because debt financing is supported, and protected by the laws of every country in the world.
If you loan money to a company, the law is on your side if the company doesn't pay you back.
If Lily can't pay back a $200 million loan, the lenders go to the courts,
and the courts will allow the lenders to go in and take Lily's assets and do whatever they can to get their money back.

Cost of Capital: It is the cost of obtaining external financing, combining the cost of borrowing and the cost of equity investment.
It determines which projects are profitable and worth pursuing.
Debt vs. Equity Financing: Debt financing involves borrowing money at an interest rate,
while equity financing involves investors expecting a return. Debt is generally cheaper due to legal protections for lenders,
whereas equity is riskier and demands higher returns.
Project Viability: The cost of capital helps decide which projects to fund. Projects with returns higher than the cost of capital
are good investments, while those with lower returns are not.

Here are the key takeaways from the video "Cost of capital: Split debt-equity financing":

Mix of Financing: Combining debt and equity financing can balance the cost of capital.
For example, a 50/50 split between debt and equity has different implications than a 90/10 split.
Risk and Return: Equity investors require a higher return due to higher risk, as they are paid after lenders.
Lenders have a priority claim, making their position less risky but still influenced by the amount of equity cushion.
Project Viability: The right mix of debt and equity can lower the total cost of capital, making a project feasible.
For instance, a mix that results in a cost of capital lower than the expected cash flows can make a project viable.

These points highlight how the balance between debt and equity affects the overall cost of capital and project success.


90% Debt, 10% Equity
Lenders: $180 million + 8% ir = $194 million
Investors: $20 million  + 18% ir = $24 million

QUESTION: Why do we even need investors when you have a loan at such a lower IR?
////////////////////////
WACC: Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC)
////////////////////////

Here are the key takeaways from the video "Weighted-average cost of capital":

Calculation of WACC: The weighted average cost of capital (WACC) is calculated by averaging
the costs of debt and equity financing, weighted by their respective proportions in the capital structure.
Project Evaluation: Companies use WACC to evaluate the attractiveness of various projects.
If the expected return on a project is higher than the WACC, the project is considered good.
Optimal Capital Structure: Finding the optimal mix of debt and equity financing can minimize WACC,
allowing for more attractive projects. For example, a 90% debt and 10% equity mix might provide the lowest WACC.

These points illustrate how WACC is used to determine the cost of financing and evaluate potential projects.

+--------------------+---------------------+----------------------+----------------------------------+
| Capital Structure  | Cost of Debt (LIR)  | Cost of Equity (EIR) | Weighted Average Cost of Capital |
+--------------------+---------------------+----------------------+----------------------------------+
| 100% Debt          | 0.12                | n/a                  | 0.12

10.5% WACC vc 10% Expected Operating Return (NO GOOD)

A company making containers takes out a one-year loan of $75 million at an interest rate of 8 percent,
to accomplish a facility refurbishment.
What is the minimum amount the project needs to return at the end of the year?
75M * (1.0 * 0.08) = 75M + 6M = 81M
QUESTION: What about Risk-Free Rate?
QUESTION: How WACC can be plugged into CAPM?

Securities
Bond vs Stock
Stock -> Ownership of a company (equity)
Bonds -> Loan made to a company (debt) (IOU)

Pure Debt - Interest payments mandatory (Payment amount is fixed, Loans needs to be repaid)
Pure Equity - Dividend payments are optional (Variable, not needed to be paid/repaid)

Ownership vs. Loan: Stocks represent ownership in a corporation (equity),
while bonds represent a loan made to the corporation (debt).
Payments: Interest payments on bonds are mandatory and fixed,
whereas dividend payments on stocks are optional and variable.
Repayment: Bonds have a maturity date and must be repaid,
while stocks do not require repayment of the initial investment.
Bankruptcy Priority: In case of bankruptcy, bondholders are paid first,
and stockholders receive any remaining assets.

Purpose of Stock Markets: Stock markets are places, either physical or virtual,
where people can trade stocks. Examples include the New York Stock Exchange and NASDAQ.
Social Value: Stock markets provide a platform for trading used shares,
which encourages initial investments in companies by providing liquidity and the ability to sell shares in the future.
The analogy with the Used Car Market: Just like a used car market makes it easier to buy new cars,
the existence of a stock market makes it more likely for people to invest in stocks,
knowing they can sell them later if needed.

Bonds, various types:
- Sovereign Bonds - Government Bonds issued by countries
- Municipal Bonds - (Sub sovereign bonds, issued by cities, provinces, states, or gov agencies)
- Corporate Bonds - (Issued by companies, about 30% of all bonds are issued by companies)
- Asset-Backed Bonds - Assets like company's account receivable, home mortgages)

Securitization: Asset-backed bonds are created through securitization,
where cash flows from assets like mortgages or accounts receivable are bundled to back the bonds.

Public debt: company bonds publicly traded
Private debt: most companies' loans occur through private debt, borrowed directly from a bank or group of banks
"Bonds are traded over the counter" 10 of thousands of companies issuing bonds. (Individually traded by a broker)
Not as volatile as stocks.

Bond complexity - one company may have multiple different bonds with characteristics such as:
- Maturity date
- Interest Rate
- Collateral privilege

Market Dynamics: Share prices are determined by the interactions of buyers and sellers in the market,
similar to how prices for goods like milk or gasoline are set.
Influencing Factors: New information about a company's future sales, net income,
overall economic trends, industry events, political stability,
and investor confidence can cause share prices to change.
Benefits and Costs of Going Public: Being publicly traded can make it easier to raise
capital and boost a company's reputation, but it also comes with increased regulation and
potential loss of control for the founders.

"The new shareholders may have different ideas about how the company should be run.
So there are both benefits and costs associated with being a publicly traded company.
The vast majority of companies in the world are not publicly traded. For example,
in the United States, there are 4,000 companies that are publicly traded and 15 million companies that are not."

Initial public offering (IPO): Microsoft

- When a company offers its shares to the public for the first time, the event is called an IPO,
or Initial Public Offering. Because there is no active buying and selling before the shares are listed publicly,
an initial price must be set just to get things going. This initial price is set by the listing company and its financial advisors.
Let's take a look at an example of a company that went public a little more than 30 years ago.
Microsoft went public on March 13th, 1986. The company had been operating since 1975 as a privately held company.
A number of employees had been given shares as part of their compensation, but there was no market in which to trade those shares.
Now, in 1985, the year before the IPO, Microsoft had earnings per share of $1.10. At the time of Microsoft's IPO,
there were several other software companies that were already publicly trading. Those companies, on average,
were trading at a PE ratio, or price to earnings ratio, of about 15. In other words, the market values of these
companies were about 15 times as large as those company's most recent annual net income. >>>>> Okay,
so what is a reasonable estimate of the initial value of Microsoft Shares,
given that the company's most recent earnings per share was $1.10. That initial estimate,
which founder Bill Gates and his financial advisors used, was $16.50 per share, computed as $1.10 earnings per share,
multiplied by the industry average PE ratio of 15. Okay, so this is an initial rough estimate,
but would investors buy the shares at that $16.50 price? <<<<<<< Bill Gates and his investment advisors did what companies
always do as they're preparing to go public, they conducted a road show. They went around the world and gave presentations
about Microsoft to large investors, mutual funds, pension funds, and so forth. They told these large investors that
the initial price per share estimate was $16.50, and asked them if they would be willing to invest at that price.
And at that $16.50 price, lots of people wanted to buy Microsoft shares. Now, who suffers if the initial share price is too low?
Well, the original shareholders, such as the founders, Bill Gates and his partner Paul Allen, they are not fully compensated
for their work in creating the company. Alright, let's look at the other side. What's the danger if the initial price is too high?
Well, then nobody wants to buy these overpriced shares. The IPO shares are said to be undersubscribed.
This results in bad publicity. So, what happened with the Microsoft IPO? Given the positive feedback from the roadshow,
Bill Gates and his investment advisors decided to set the initial share price at $21 a share,
a bit of an increase over the initial $16.50 number computed using the PE ratio. Well,
the Microsoft shares proved to be an instant success in the market. At the end of the first day of trading,
the share price was up to $27.75, about a 30% increase in one day. Contrast this with Uber's recent IPO.
Uber went public at $45 per share on May 10th, 2019. Their stock price dropped on day one, and then one month
later they were selling at around $41 per share. About a 10% drop for the month. Hey, not all IPOs win.
The IPO price is set using accounting data, industry data, and the investor interest uncovered during the roadshow.
Once the shares are trading in the market, the interactions of buyers and sellers determine the price.
So, back to Microsoft. What is the current price of those Microsoft shares that sold for $21 in the IPO? Well,
those shares have been multiplied in a process called stock splits. So each original share is now equal to 288 shares.
As of June 19th, 2019, the aggregate price of those shares is now about $39,600. From the $21 IPO price up to now,
$39,600. Not bad.

Setting the Initial Price: Microsoft's initial share price was estimated based on its earnings per share and the industry average price-to-earnings (PE) ratio.
Roadshow: Bill Gates and his advisors conducted a roadshow to gauge investor interest and adjust the initial share price accordingly.
IPO Outcome: The initial share price was set at $21, and by the end of the first trading day, it increased to $27.75, showing a successful IPO.

Time Value of Money: A dollar today is worth more than a dollar in the future due to the potential earning capacity.
This concept is crucial in evaluating long-term projects.
Capital Budgeting: This process involves evaluating long-term investments and projects,
considering the time value of money to determine their worth.
Interest Rate Example: Using an interest rate of 10%, the video illustrates how the present
value of a long-term investment (like a machine producing $1 per year for a billion years)
is calculated to be significantly lower than its total future value.
