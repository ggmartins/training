# 1. AWS Intro

- On-demand delivery of compute, storage, database and IT resources
- pay-as-you-go
- provision the exact type and size of computing resources you need
- instant access to resources through friedly interface

Private Cloud:

- Cloud services used by a single organization
- Complete Control
- Security for sensitive apps
- Meet specific business needs

Public Cloud:

- AWS, Azure, GCP
- Cloud resources owned and operated by a third-party cloud service provider delivered over the internet
- Five characteristics:
  - On demand self service - user provision resources without help from providers
  - Broad network access - resources can be accessed by a diverse network
  - multi-tenancy and resource pooling
    - multiple customers can share the same infrastructure and apps with security and privacy
    - multiple customers are serviced from the same physical resources
  - rapid elasticity and scalability - automatically and quick acquire and dispose resources when needed, easily scale on demand
  - immediate access
  - measured resources
- Six advantages:
  - no up front cost, trade CAPEX (capital expense) for OPEX (operational expense)
    - Pay on demand, don't own hardware
  - benefit from massive economy of scale
    - prices are reduced as AWS is more efficient due to the large scale
  - stop guessing capacity
    - scale based on actual measured capacity
  - increase speed and agility
  - no money on data center maintenaince
  - go global in minutes
- In other words:
  - Flexibility: change resources type when needed
  - Cost-effectiveness: pay-as-you-go, for what you use
  - Scalability: accommodate larger workloads by adding more nodes or upgrading existing hw
  - Elasticity: ability to scale-out or scale-in when needed
  - High availability and fault-tolerance: build across data centers / availability zones
  - Agility: rapidly develop, test and launch software applications

Hybrid Cloud:
- Keep some servers on-prem
- Extend capabilities to the cloud
- Control over sensitive assent on prem
- flexibility and cost effectiveness of the cloud

## 1.1 Types of Cloud Computing

- IaaS Infrastructure as a Service - building blocks of cloud IT (eg EC2):
  - network,
  - computers,
  - storage etc.
  - Highest Level of Flexibility
  - Easy parallel with traditional on-premises IT
- PaaS Platform as a Service (eg. Elastic Beanstalk):
  - No need to manage underlaying infrastructure
  - Focus on deploying and managing applications 
- SaaS Software as a Service: (ex. Rekognition for ML)
  - Complete software that runs on the cloud.

## 1.2 Pricing

3 pricing fundamentals in pay-as-you-go:

- Compute - pay for compute time
- Storage - pay for the data stored (size) in the cloud
- Networking - pay for data transferred OUT (not in)
(solves the expensive issue of traditional IT)


## 1.3 Coming from Azure

Core mental model: how AWS “feels” vs Azure:

- Tenant vs. Org:
  - Azure: AAD tenant → Management Groups → Subscriptions → Resource Groups → Resources
  - AWS: Organizations → OUs → Accounts (hard isolation boundary) → Regions/AZs → VPCs → Resources
- Tip: Think “many small AWS accounts” instead of “one subscription with many RGs.”
- Identity & auth: Azure AD + RBAC → AWS IAM roles/policies + IAM Identity Center (SSO). Assume roles, don’t pass keys.
- Policy & governance: Azure Policy/Blueprints → AWS Service Control Policies (SCPs) + AWS Config + Organizations.
- Networking: VNet/peering/vWAN → VPC/peering/Transit Gateway. Security groups are stateful; NACLs are stateless.

Org & identity you’ll set up first:

- AWS Organizations: Create OUs (e.g., security/, sandbox/, workloads/) and accounts per env (dev/test/prod).
- IAM Identity Center (SSO): Connect to your IdP (Entra ID works) → Permission Sets → Users assume roles in accounts.
- Guardrails: (Service Control Policies) SCPs (deny root access key, deny non-approved regions, require tagging), AWS Config + conformance packs, CloudTrail org-trail.
